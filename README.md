### Notes for use
- The "main" file for the interface, utility, etc.. are in "/Source/V1/Ligma_Main.rbxmx", it will appear that it's all KeyFrames, but in Studio use the explorer filter and type "ScreenGui", "Script", etc.., and you should find where it's located.
- I do not hold any liability for these files, and I for a fact know some are even currupted (Mainly the PLinkers), and I'm providing exactly what I got and recieved with no modifications.
- It has been pointed out that some of these files are related to "Voxel", a project by Outmoon. I'm not sure why that's in here, but whatever.
